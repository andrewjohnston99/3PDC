# ATL Traffic Log
CS 4365 Semester Project

## Setup

### Materials Needed:

1. Raspberry Pi 3B+ (others may work but are untested)
2. MicroSD Card for Boot Drive (Min 16GB, Recommend Class 10)
3. USB Type-A Storage Device (Necessary size depends on number of cams and time to store, we are using 128GB flash storage drives)
4. 5V Power Supply for Pi (refer to model specific amperage recommendations)

### Software Installation:

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS to MicroSD Card to boot a clean instance. You can reuse a previous install but some pre-existing applications may interfere with the ATL Traffic Log code.

2. Check that Python 3 is installed using the following command: `$python3 --version`.
Our OS came preinstalled with Python 3.7.3 however anything newer than this should be supported. If issues arise, consider matching our version.

3. Install Node.js using the following command: `sudo apt-get install nodejs`.
